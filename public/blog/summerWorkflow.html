            <h1>How Summer Affected My Workflow And Habits</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
        It was the start of summer, I had just finished my second year of Uni and 
        I hadn't managed to get an internship. This left me in a situation where 
        I ideally needed to do something with my summer in order to keep up with 
        others who had landed internships. As my overall goal was to become a better 
        developer I split my focus into the following areas:
        <ul>
            <li>Improve my programming skills through completing projects</li>
            <li>Create a project portfolio to better my CV</li>
            <li>Expand knowledge around my subject</li>
            <li>Research different software tools (as summer is a rather risk free 
                time to try all these out as efficiency isn't vital)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Improving Programming Skills</h2>
        <div class="row w-100">
            <img src="../../assets/summerWorkflow/GitHubGraph.png" alt="GitHub graph" class="col align-self-center"
            style="max-height: 150px; object-fit: contain;">
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
        For this goal my primary solution to getting better at programming was to 
        do it more and do it consistently. For this I attempted to form the habit 
        of coding once a day. This proved tricky as sometimes there are other aspects 
        of life that require more attention. For instance, I felt it was probably 
        best I left the laptop at home when I went to meet my girlfriend's parents 
        for the first time. Due to this I created the goal to attempt to code daily 
        and a measurement of that habit which gave leeway. My measurement for this 
        was that I had to have 80% of my daily squares filled in on GitHub (I went 
        with 80 as my old gym coach used to say for athletes to excel they needed to maintain 
        an attendance of more than 80%, so I embraced my programmer side and just 
        copied and pasted).
        </p>
        <p>
        For this coding habit I decided to develop the image sorter app for a 
        friend. This was originally a team project so would not only help buff out 
        my project portfolio but would also improve my team working skills. Unfortunately
        the other programmers did not want to follow in my footsteps and instead 
        opted to enjoy their summer. Despite this I still got a project where I could 
        code daily. Not only learning from my mistakes but also improving upon the 
        use of my tools such as VIM motions where I jumped around much quicker in 
        debugging as time went on.
        </p>
        <h2>Creating A Project Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
        This was quite a challenging task as I have spent little time with web 
        development and even less on developing nice looking stuff on the web. With this 
        I needed to find a balance where it was quick enough that it wouldn't be a 
        project in itself but polished enough that I would want to display it. To 
        do this I opted to use the bootstrap framework for all my styling as despite 
        it creating a bunch of very ugly in-line CSS it was efficient in making 
        the web page look somewhat polished, meaning I could focus on the content.
        </p>
        <p>
        After creating the project portfolio, which took longer than expected, 
        especially when looking through projects from many years ago where I had
        to understand the tech stack along with key details to write about. I decided 
        it would also be good to add a blog to the page as despite many example 
        portfolios I looked at not having them I felt that at the end of the day 
        this is my portfolio and it is made not only for employers but also for 
        future me to look back on, and so I felt a blog was an effective way to 
        look back into my past experiences and relive the thought processes that took 
        place so I can hopefully see how far I have come in aspects other than just the 
        end products.
        </p>
        <h2>Expanding Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
        Since there was more time as I was on break I could finally reorganise 
        my emails and delete a bunch so I would have a clean inbox. This led to 
        me properly looking at emails when they came up rather than just leaving them 
        to add up. This benefited me as it meant when tech newsletters such as 
        Hacker News popped up in my inbox I would actually read them. Leading me to 
        explore new technologies and concepts as well as keeping me updated in the 
        big news for that week.
        </p>
        <p>
        Along with my daily coding habit I also decided to read daily. As I'm 
        dyslexic this is quite a slow process so I tend to only read non-fiction 
        books within my field so I don't feel I'm wasting my time. I started 
        off this habit with the aim to read just 3 pages a day, however, this 
        went up to 5 pages as it is easier to count, and then 10 as I began to 
        get into the habit of reading. Below are the 
        books and more importantly my opinion and their impact.
        </p>
        <h3>The Pragmatic Programmer</h3>
        <p>
        This was the first book I picked up when I started to read again. I found 
        its tips useful and overall enjoyed the read. However, due to the way I read 
        it I have likely forgotten many of the tips, due to this I plan to reread 
        it, implementing what I learnt from Pragmatic Thinking and Learning so I 
        may fully absorb the information.
        </p>
        <h3>The Cyber Effect</h3>
        <p>
        This book is about technology and its psychological impact on various social
        groups and societal norms. For this book I found roughly 2/3 of it interesting
        with the chapters being very hit and miss and some of the connections seeming 
        a little far-fetched. However, the chapters on its impact on babies, its 
        impact on dating and its impact on extreme kinks were interesting.
        </p>
        <h3>Pragmatic Thinking and Learning</h3>
        <p>
        This book was very interesting as it discusses various ways of learning, 
        along with various personality types and their importance in a workforce.
        This book probably impacted my workflow the most as I have implemented 
        many changes, some of these include - using a second monitor of similar 
        size when possible (this reduces context switching), being strict when on 
        a task and not going back and forth from others as this context switching 
        can make you 20-40% less productive (20mins regain focus), reorganised 
        my emails with folders for better experience and finally, using obsidian 
        for note taking as it allows you to build connections between pages which 
        can later be easily transferred to a mind map at a later date as you can  
        view these connections as a graph. With obsidian I would also make summaries 
        of what I learned in each chapter of new books to reinforce the concepts 
        and give me a place of reference.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Practical Vim</h3>
        <p>
        Before reading this book, I had already been using neovim for about 2 months,
        however, I would only utilise movement with numbers and the movement keys/word keys.
        I also had a basic understanding of using macros, but that was it, when it 
        came to utilising command mode or using markers I was clueless. This book 
        helped me massively in my flow as I could now use vim for more than just its 
        basic movements (also using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd> to exit insert mode was a massive time 
        saver after remapping the control key to caps lock).
        </p>
        <h3>Modern Vim</h3>
        <p>
        This book was the sequel in a way to Practical Vim, with this it went into 
        features specific to neovim. Overall, I found this book underwhelming 
        where many of it wasn't that useful. Two useful things I did after this 
        book was firstly, looking at my telescope plug-in and configuring it to also find 
        help documents quicker and secondly, utilise the terminal emulator, as I 
        am already in tmux this wasn't useful in most cases, however, it was 
        amazing for running local servers as I am sometimes forgetful when it comes 
        to stopping the terminal in the other window. Having both within neovim meant 
        when I was done editing I would also shut down the server.
        </p>
        <h3>tmux 2</h3>
        <p>
        This book was interesting and showed me more potential in the tool through 
        examples such as pair programming remotely using ssh and sessions. The main 
        change this prompted from me was to utilise multiple sessions more over 
        multiple windows, this again helped prevent me from context switching.
        </p>
        <h3>Code Complete 2nd Edition</h3>
        <p>
        At the time of writing this I am only 150 pages into this rather large 
        book. I am enjoying it and feel it is already teaching me better habits,
        such as the importance of design and architecture before coding begins.
        </p>
        <h3>Readers Note</h3>
        <p>
        If you have any interesting recommendations for me to read next, please 
        send them my way at <a href="mailto: sonnykidd@icloud.com">sonnykidd@icloud.com</a>.
        I currently plan to read The Mythical Man-moth next and purchase Design Patterns 
        from the gang of four for OOP references.

        <h2>Software Tools And Workflow Changes</h2>

        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
        For main projects and important work, I will still use an IDE, however with a 
        vim motion plug-in. For personal projects I am using tmux with neovim. To 
        help with context switching and navigation around my computer with minimal 
        mouse interaction I am also using skhd and yabai for a tiling manager.
