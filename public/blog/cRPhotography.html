       <h1>Photography Folder Ordering App</h1> 
       <p>
       This project was handed to me by an old friend who now works for 
       World Rowing in sports photography. He came across the issue of organising
       his folders by bow number at this large competition when the boats did 
       not set off in the correct order. He wanted an app which would look at 
       the image and sort the folders from features of this image. After asking
       me for help I got two other Bristol students to help divide the work load,
       sorted a contract and got started.

       <h2>July 17th 2024 (1 and a half months in)</h2>
       <p>
       After a month and a half I have completed a fair chunk of the frontend,
       just requiring 3 more issues to be complete until the core functionality
       of the frontend has finished. However, at this point I have found a few 
       issues.
       <ol>
           <li>Client still hasn't sent the test data, resulting in:</li>
           <ul>
               <li>Back end having not been started due to no data to 
               research models on. This is made worse by the fact that 
               the more competent engineer leaves for Singapore at the 
               start of September so will likely become hands off at this point</li>
           </ul>
           <li>The other two group members have yet to start the back end,
           one due to not having test data and the other because they are 
           busy. Due to the frontend having nearly been completed and 
           the backend having yet to be started I am tempted to remove these
           two members from the team. However, this will produce the following
           problems:</li>
           <ul>
               <li>Larger work load for me, meaning the project will not 
               be completed on time. Is also more likely to result in 
               burnout as more overwhelming</li>
               <li>If I am the only person on the project I do not have 
               differing personalities and opionions to challenge my own 
               leading to the possabilility of more narrow-minded code that 
               could be reflected in the UI</li>
           </ul>
           <li>Balancing this project with other tasks. Due to it being the 
           summer I am in preparation for internship applying. This means
           I need to set up my project portfolio webpage and polish my 
           CV before I return back to summer. This portfolio is made harder
           by the fact that I do not feel proficient in web development so am
           learning this alongside the portfolio development itself to 
           ensure best practices are used</li>
       </ol>
