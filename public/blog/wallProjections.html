        <p>
        Back in September five of us gathered round a table thinking about the prompt
        given to us by Bristol Museum: develop an interactive exhibit where visitors
        touch replicas of artefacts and related information appears, creating an
        interesting and fun way to learn about these objects.
        </p>
        <p>
        After many months and iterations, we finally came to the design you see
        above, an exhibit consisting hotspots over the replicas on a table. When
        the hotspots are touched, information about each artifact is displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
        But how did we get here? With little idea on how to tackle such a task we
        split it into the three logical sections: how do people interact with the
        replicas? How do we display the information? How do we make it easy for
        museum staff to use in future exhibitions?
        </p>
        <h3>How do people interact with the replicas?</h3>
        <p>
        This was tough as we didn't have any examples to work off - we couldn't
        find anyone who'd done something similar.
        </p>
        <p>
        We explored many possible solutions; looking at methods such as computer
        vision, lasers and detecting decreases in light. Through our exploration we
        ultimately settled on MediaPipe; an AI-powered hand tracking model which
        allowed us to see how users touched the replicas.
        </p>
        <div class="row w-100">
            <img src="/assets/wallProjections/Picture1.png" alt="Image of how hotspots are selected" class="center"
            style="height: 150px; object-fit: contain;">
        </div>
        <p>
        We created hotspots in which the replicas could be placed and animations
        to prompt visitors to interact.
        </p>
        <p>
        While two of us worked on this, the rest of the team was busy creating a
        user interface, so users could engage with the exhibition.
        </p>
        <h3>How do we display the information?</h3>
        <p>
        This was a simpler task; the museum had informed us that they wanted
        to use projectors to show this information, so we created a dynamic
        display with a black background and white text to make it less blocky
        and more appealing to the eye. After a few iterations with museum staff
        and user feedback we came to the structure shown. Videos, image
        slideshows and text can all be included.
        </p>
        <div class="row w-100">
            <img src="/assets/wallProjections/Picture2.png" alt="Image of model display screen" class="center"
            style="height: 200px; object-fit: contain;">
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>How do we make it easy for museum staff to use in future exhibitions?</h3>
        <p>
        We wanted to create an easy-to-use system with equipment most museums
        would already have.
        </p>
        <p>
        A projector displays hotspots and a camera detects when people touch
        them. The camera and projector can be calibrated with the click of
        a button. A second projector displays information, which changes
        according to how the users interact with the hotspots.
        </p>
        <p>
        We also designed an editor allowing staff to add, remove and position
        the hotspots, and attach relevant information to them. We added import
        and export features, so the design can be used on different machines.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
        Overall this was a fun project to work on. We learnt a lot
        about computer vision, hardware, frontend development and
        working as a team on a larger project. We are grateful for Bristol
        Museum for coming to us with such an interesting
        task and are looking forward to seeing this software in action.
