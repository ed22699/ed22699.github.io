            <h1>How Summer Affected My Workflow And Habits</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
        It was the start of summer, I had just finished my second year of Uni and 
        I hadn't managed to get an internship. This left me in a situation where 
        I ideally needed to do something with my summer in order to keep up with 
        others who had landed internships. As my overall goal was to become a better 
        developer I split my focus into the following areas:
        <ul>
            <li>Improve my programming skills through completing projects</li>
            <li>Create a project portfolio to better my CV</li>
            <li>Expand knowledge around my subject</li>
            <li>Research different software tools (as summer is a rather risk free 
                time to try all these out as efficiency isn't vital)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Improving Programming Skills</h2>
        <p>
        For this goal my primary solution to getting better at programming was to 
        do it more and do it consistently. For this I attempted to form the habit 
        of coding once a day. This proved tricky as sometimes their are other aspects 
        of life that require more attention. For instance I felt it was probably 
        best I left the laptop at home when I went to meet my girlfriends parents 
        for the first time. Due to this I created the goal to attempt to code daily 
        and a measurement of that habit which gave leeway. My measurement for this 
        was that I had to have 80% of my daily squares filled in on GitHub (I went 
        with 80 as my old gym coach used to say for athletes to excel they needed to maintain 
        an attendance of more than 80%, so I embraced my programmers side and just 
        copied and pasted).
        </p>
        <p>
        For this coding habit I decided to develop the image sorter app for a 
        friend. This was originally a team project so would not only help buff out 
        my project portfolio but would also improve my team working skills. Unfortunately
        the other programmers did not want to follow in my footsteps and instead 
        opted to enjoy their summer. Despite this I still got a project where I could 
        code daily. Not only learning from my mistakes but also improving upon the 
        use of my tools such as VIM motions where I jumped around much quicker in 
        debugging as time went on.
        </p>
        <h2>Creating A Project Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
        This was quite a challenging task as I have spent little time with web 
        development and even less on developing nice looking stuff on the web. With this 
        I needed to find a balance where it was quick enough that it wouldn't be a 
        project in itself but polished enough that I would want to display it. To 
        do this I opted to use the bootstrap framework for all my styling as despite 
        it creating a bunch of very ugly in-line CSS it is efficient in making 
        the web page look somewhat polished, meaning I could focus on the content.
        </p>
        <p>
        After creating the project portfolio, which took longer than expected, 
        especially when looking through projects from many years ago where I had
        to understand the tech stack along with key details to write about. I decided 
        it would also be good to add a blog to the page as despite many example 
        portfolios I looked at not having them I felt that at the end of the day 
        this is my portfolio and it is made not only for employers but also for 
        future me to look back on, and so I felt a blog was an effective way to 
        look back into my past experiences and relive the thought processes that took 
        place so I can hopefully see how far I have come in aspects other than just the 
        end products.
