        <p>
            I first heard about vim your typical way, A professor on my
            Software tools module was the power
            of vim commands and its use as a text editor. However, like many
            I dismissed it and when about my life in VSCode and occasionally
            IntelliJ.
        </p>
        <p>
            About a year and a half later I came across a video by
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen">The Primeagen</a>
            going over the benefits of vim. As a student coming up to their
            end of year exams I was searching for all possible methods of
            procrastination as so now was the perfect time to begin my journey
            into vim commands and NeoVim.
        </p>

        <h2>The Initial Struggle</h2>
        <p>
            Being an arrogant uni student I of course ignored all the advice of
            beginning with a vim command VSCode plugin and instead jumped right
            into NeoVim, downloaded the first config I found and opened my
            brand-new editor. Instead, I was greeted with an odd looking
            blue screen and no idea why. I spent the rest of the day trying to
            solve this and ultimately decided that maybe I should listen to the
            advice and begin with the commands.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began to learn the commands, scribbling them all down on a piece of
            paper as I went. I could see this youtuber using
            <a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/vim-be-good">vim-be-good</a>
            plugin, however, I didn't even know what a plugin was resulting in me
            hating this whole process more and instead going to the vim game
            <a href="https://vim-adventures.com">vim-adventures</a> which lightened
            my mood and motivated me to give this another go
        </p>
        <h2>Creating My Config</h2>
        <p>
            On my second attempt into configs and plugins, I decided to start at
            the beginning. My plan was the process of writing my config would
            in turn get me better at vim commands along the way. I began with
            adding a custom font, this bought me back to the dreadded blue screen
            I saw before, however, this time I could actually see the cause of
            this issue without the multitude of other plugins. I realised that
            my Mac terminal does not support true colour, and so changed to ITerm
            I was finally understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            After many tutorials I finally completed my config using packer, added
            in my favourite remaps and settings and went into the world to tell
            everyone the joys of NeoVim (something my girlfriend lost enthusiasm
            for after the 8th conversation).
        </p>

        <h2>Using Tmux</h2>
        <p>
            After some time I decided I wanted more, I could see people with
            terminals set up alongside their setups and I wanted to know how.
            I began a small dive into Tmux and that's when I discovered another level
            of control. Soon my rants turned from just vim to the terminal as a
            whole and how I have so much power with this tool.
        </p>
        <p>
            I still feel I have much to learn about the terminal and its powers
            and look forward to annoying my girlfriend once more with a new rant
            about my new found powers.
        </p>

            style="height: 600px; object-fit: contain;">
        </div>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Overall I loved this process. It's turned programming back into more
            of a game as I code daily, so I can become a vim God and better programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
            This has led me to not only understand terminal more but prompted me to
            want to be a better programmer and learn more outside of class, causing
            me to:
        <ul>
            <li>Learn LaTeX (configured to work within NeoVim of course)</li>
            <li>Learn and use snippets (although they are a feature in
                other editors I strayed away from many of these features
                until recently)</li>
            <li>Code daily (aim to maintain 80% other green on github graph)</li>
            <li>Read daily (so I can learn more ideas and tools that I could have
                missed)</li>
            <li>Code more projects (I want to be better, currently coding
                a Lua plugin, a project portfolio and a character recognition
                photography sorting app)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Further Improvements</h2>
        <p>
            If I create a new config I will like to make the following changes:
        <ul>
            <li>Use Lazy.lua as I found a lot more plugins had instructions
                for this instead of packer which would save a headache and likely
                allow more control over these plugins</li>
            <li>Use less plugins in general. This forces me to rely more on
                vim commands likely leading to a better understanding of vim</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
